            <p class="mb-5">Many Natural Language Processing systems rely on producing predicate argument structures as canonical representations of sentences that abstract away from syntactic variation. Computational lexicons in the form of valency lexicons that can support the formation of such predicate argument structures therefore play an enduring role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, as key enablers of such abstractions. 
            The PropBank frame files (or their FrameNet and VerbNet cousins) provide the foundation for Semantic Role Labeling systems as well as English Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsers.<br>
            Pre-existing language-specific Frame Files, or other types of valency lexicons, simplify the task of spinning up AMR annotation projects for new languages such as Chinese and Arabic. However, there are many unresolved fundamental questions having to do with the creation of such lexicons, and how to draw the boundaries between distinct senses and distinct word forms.<br>
            This workshop therefore solicits submissions that review existing computational valency lexicons that are widely used in NLP, the contributions they make and the lexicographic techniques used in their development. We are especially interested in papers that address the complications that arise with polysynthetic languages and their incorporation of certain semantic concepts such as aspect or enablement as prefixes rather than as distinct lexical items such as verbs, as is preferred by analytic languages.<br>  
            We also welcome submissions that address questions about the boundaries of compounds and multi-word expressions, and criteria for determining when they should have distinct entries.  <br>
            Any papers that discuss issues that arise when mapping between valency lexicons in multiple languages, such as differences in argument structure, are also especially relevant. </p>
